18) Starting with a 2D square. If the sides are divided into 3 and the middle square removed you have 8 copies of the original square.
Therefore fractal dimension for the 2D Menger gasket is

$$\frac{\log(8)}{\log(3)} = 1.893 $$
For the 3D Menger sponge. Starting with a cube, if the sides are divided by 3, there are 8+4+8 resulting cubes. This gives a fractal dimension of
$$\frac{\log(20)}{\log(3)} = 2.727 $$
