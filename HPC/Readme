14th December

HPC coursework


The zipped pg5117.tgz in Results contains the data files, error files, the bash scripts and cluster_R

Question 20, to load the HPC files, calls on the sub directory /Results/Unzipped this directory has been .gitignored to avoid loading duplicate large sets of datafiles - so question 20 will not run as it stands.


The Code directory contains a pdf file and the Rmd files used to create it.
The Cpde directory also contaisn pg5117.R with all the scripts except cluster_run.
ALl scripts are written as the specified function names an run without any inputs -EXCEPT the fractals scripts which requrie the plot window and a function call - which is included in the script.
