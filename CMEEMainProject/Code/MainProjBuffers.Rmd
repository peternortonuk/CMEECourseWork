In this analysis the land cover around the woodlands will be used to create indices per site. Broad habitat were recorded in three zones round the sites with radii of 1500, 2500 and 3500m respectively. Habitats were designated according to seven groups. Intensive, semi-natural, broad-leaved woodland, conifer woodland, aquatic and coastal. Intensive includes arable, urban and gardens.

The proportion of each category was entered for each site, but sometimes mutiple entries occur for one category. For example, under intensive there might be four proportions covering arable, urban, set-aside and improved grassland. We are interested in species richness of the woodlands and any factors which might contribute, negatively or positively, to that. Of the above categories intensive could potentially have a negative effect by reducing the surrounding species pool, being a source of nitrification and increasing anthropogenic impacts such as trampling and dog use. Therefore, in order to combine the categories into one index per site, the proportion of woodlands, semi-natural, aquatic and coastal will be summed to give a single value denoting a positive potential for the surrounding environmental effect on the site.  

```{r}
land_buffers = read.csv("../Data/Land_cover_in_bufferz.csv")
# then just select cols of interest, and change 3500m to buffer 3 etc, easier to use in for loop later
land_buffers = land_buffers%>%select(SITE, Buffer, Propn, Category)
land_buffers$Buffer[land_buffers$Buffer == 3500] = 3
land_buffers$Buffer[land_buffers$Buffer == 2500] = 2
land_buffers$Buffer[land_buffers$Buffer == 1500] = 1

pos = c("W","C","S","Aq","Co") # the positive codes

      pos_buffer = buffer_zone%>% filter(Category %in% pos)
