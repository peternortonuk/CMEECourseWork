To run the code the data "table_DBH_live_counts_71-03.csv" is required in the data directory and working directory should be Code.

There are some handy funtions to examine the data: PlotSite(Site) and PlotPlot(Site,Plot) will give bar charts from year 2 aggregated dbh measurements. DBH(Site,Plot) will give the dbh counts for a plot and In(Site,Plot) will give the index for a plot. GetSites_mean, GetSites_skew and GetSites_regress will produce 4 bar charts for plots random;y selected from the woodlands which have means, skews or regression slopes within the lower and upper parameters given to the function.
Means_df[i,j], Skews_df[i,j], Medians_df[i,j] and Regress_df[i,j] will return those metrics or Site i Plot j.

#Introduction
The purpose of this exploration is to examine the use of various metrics calculated from the frequency distribution of the DBH class interval. We want to find a metric for each plot which describes the succession, or the time since a disturbance event. If the plot has lost large trees, due to storm damage for example, then regeneration will occur with a large number of saplings very shortly after the event. The plot will follow a succession which we would expect to see in the dbh frequency distribution as the class with the highest frequency increases at the same time as the frequency itself decreases. (The j shaped distribution moves to the right) If there had been no disturbance, and and further time since an event, the distribution of dbh will be more even, with more trees in the large dbh classes and with lower frequencies. (Lokking more like a squished normal).

This metric is therefore a function of the maximum frequency, the dbh classes showing counts and the degree of difference between the frequencies.

At one extreme, higher frequencies, more counts in lower dbh classes, and large differences between adjacent classes would represent a recent event. At the other, low frequencies, more of the higher dbh classes being occupied and with the frequencies overall being less differentiated should imply longer time since an event.

All the dbh data is imported from DBH_live_counts. This is filtered to just look at year 2. Since there are multiple species, each plot has multiple lines per DBH class per plot. These were therefore aggregated, so that this analysis is ignoring species.

The dbh classes in the raw data are recorded in 5cm intervals, class 1 is 5-10cm, class 2 is 5-10cm. 

(I haven't found much literature on using DBH in this way. Buchholz, 1978, DBH distribution analysis of different species to infer succession, Lorimar 1983 looked at finding even aged stands, but on looking at dbh frequency distribution says "Weibull shape parameter reflects the degree of skewness, but is not highly sensitive to horizontal displacement of mode from median", he uses a symmetry index which depends on the mode,and therefore only useful for unimodal data).


#Running sum of differences
First, the sum of running differences in count between adjacent DBH classes is trialled. Using this calculation it can be seen that a high frequency of small dbh classes would be the first term in the sum. Subsequent subtractions of smaller values would result in a large positive value. A large positive would then represent an early succession with lots of young saplings. The reverse would occur for a mature plot and a large negative number would be found.

 return(index)
}

indices =  aggregate(Count~PLOT + SITE, data = DBH_Yr2_agg, DBH_index)
colnames(indices) = c("PLOT","SITE","INDEX")
#indices are now per plot per site indices

#Some ways of exploring the idices
negs = indices%>%filter(PLOT + SITE, INDEX < 0) # just look at negative indices
DBH_class1 = DBH_Yr2_agg%>%filter(DBH_class ==1)
neg_details = inner_join(DBH_class1,negs) # all plots with neg index and trees in                                                 #dbh_class 1
```

Consider site 2 plots 10 and 11

```{r}
p1 = PlotPlot(2,10)
p2 = PlotPlot(2,11)
d1 = tableGrob(DBH(2,10))
d2 = tableGrob(DBH(2,11))
I1 = tableGrob(In(2,10))
I2 = tableGrob(In(2,11))

grid.arrange(p1,d1,I1,p2,d2, I2, nrow = 2, as.table =TRUE)
```

Plots 10 and 11 have lots of smaller trees, and therefore a similar time since an opening event. But they have indices of - 109 and 37 respectively. Plot 10 site 2 has the most negative index of all the plots, so we would want this number to imply a long time has occurred since an opening event, which it does not.

Looking at the counts, plot 10 has 12 in the first category and 69 in the next, therefore the first subtraction gives a relatively large negative value, the remaining values, all being smaller, result in a large negative index.

A negative can occur in a right skew distribution if the count of trees in the first class is low, for example, Site 1 Plot 5

```{r}
p1 = PlotPlot(1,5)
d1 = tableGrob(DBH(1,5))
I1 = tableGrob(In(1,5))
grid.arrange(p1,d1,I1, nrow = 2, as.table = TRUE)
```


This shows that the subtraction works if there are successively fewer counts in each class, and if the sum of the counts in the classes above class 1 are less than those in the first class. The most negative indices occur for sites with a large number of trees in dbh class 2, which is greater than, or similar to the number in class 1.

```{r}
head(neg_details[order(neg_details$INDEX),])

```

```{r}
p1 = PlotPlot(80,2)
p2 = PlotPlot(80,1)
p3 = PlotPlot(2,8)
p4 = PlotPlot(7,14)
grid.arrange(p1,p2,p3,p4, nrow = 2)
```
The above graphs show the plots with the four most negative indices. In each case it can be seen that combining the classes would resolve the problem. It could be argued that this is a valid solution because we are looking for a large number of small trees of a similar size, and for that size to drop of rapidly. However, since the histogram should represent the underlying frequency distribution, then these larger groups are loosing information and are not representative of the data. Therefore a solution that uses the small bin widths of the original data is preferable.

Plots of plots with mean less than 10

```{r}
#enter the lower and upper limit of the means in GetSites-Means(lower,upper)
GetSites_Means(0,10)
#You can repeatedly call this chunk to see different random selections of plots
#with means within the range specified
```
For a mean below 10 the graphs demonstrate a pattern consistent with lots of young saplings and a recent opening event. 


```{r}
GetSites_Means(10,15)
```

For means between 10 and 15 the frequency of trees in the next DBH classes increases

```{r}
GetSites_Means(15, 20)
```

As the mean increases the counts in the larger DBH classes increases, but the distribution still resembles early succession.

```{r}
GetSites_Means(20,25)
```

Means over 20 look like later successional distributions

```{r}
GetSites_Means(25,30)
```
 The means over 25 are varied, Site 18 plot 6 loks like early succession, wheres all the others do not.


```{r}
GetSites_Means(30,35)
```

Means over 30 appear to represent later succession more frequently.

With low means, because the mean is in or near the lowest dbh class, the distribution will be right skewed and fit the desired criteria of representing a plot with lots of young trees and few older ones. As the mean increases the distribution for that mean does appear to show a progression which could represent the regeneration dynamics. 

The mean will be used as a metric.

#Skew as a metric.

$$ Skew = \frac{3(mean - median)}{s}$$

The most positively skewed data accurately represents the sites with the most counts in the lowet dbh class, however, as the skew becomes more negative a pattern of progression to more negatively skewed distributions and hence more later successional plots is not clear. For example, compare Site 10 Plot 8 and Site 38 plot 3

```{r}
p1 = PlotPlot(10,8)
p2 = PlotPlot(38,3)
mean1 = (Means_df[10,8])
skew1 = Skews_df[10,8]
med1 =(Medians_df[10,8])
mean2 = (Means_df[38,3])
med2 = Medians_df[38,3]
skew2 = Skews_df[38,3]
d1 = tableGrob(as.data.frame(cbind(mean1,med1,skew1)))
d2 = tableGrob(as.data.frame(cbind(mean2,med2,skew2)))
grid.arrange(p1,d1,p2,d2, nrow = 2)
```

The distributions are very different representing very different plots. The first plot has a lot of saplings and we would want this to be showing a positive skew. The skew calculation give a negative value because the large number of small trees give a small mean, but the slightly larger count in dbh class 2 results in a median greater than the mean. For Site 38 plot 3 we would like to seeing a skew of zero representing a few large trees and no saplings.

The expectation was that the early successional plot, with a large number of saplings in the smaller classes, would give a large negative regression coefficient. This would reduce as the saplings aged and reduced in number and a regression coefficient closer to zero would be found in older plots. However, this metric does not reflect the succession. Alhough a large negative number is indicative of a large number of saplings, the change in slope is not a sensitive indcator of different states of the plot. 

##Density

Another metric that is used to examine stands is basal area/tree density. The tree density will therefore also be calculated.

#calculate the density of trees per plot - 200m^2
tree_density= function(data){
  den = data.frame()
  for (i in 1:103){
    sitedata = data%>%filter(SITE == i)
    for (j in 1:16){
      plotdata = sitedata%>%filter(PLOT == j)
      if (length(plotdata$DBH_class) != 0){
         tmp = sum(plotdata$DBH_class * plotdata$Count)
         tmp = tmp/200
         den[i,j]  = tmp}
      else{
        den[i,j] = NA
      }
      
    }
  }
  return(den)
}
plot_density = tree_density(DBH_Yr2_agg)
write.csv(plot_density, "../Data/tree_density.csv")

```
