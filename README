Week 5.
Mapping.

Went through a practical then decided to try mapping the locations of the woodlands that I am studying for my project.
These were in eastings and northings, and despite following proceedures in QGIS tutorials from various websites, I struggled to get these mapped and projected. I could map them on their own, but I couldnt tie them up with a proper UK map.

Next I decided to try mapping in R, but I couldnt download "gdal" and other libraries that were required.

Next I tried mapping in python - similar story.

The R packages would not work with 3.8.3, they wanted older versions. The python packages had many dependencies that needed to be downloaded from github, and I wasnt sure I was setting up the paths correctly etc. This prompted me to look at my pythin libraries and directory structure and realise that it seems to be a bit mangled.

After 3 days of mapping I had achieved nothing! 

Found/adapted slightly a program to change eastings and northings to OS grid refs
